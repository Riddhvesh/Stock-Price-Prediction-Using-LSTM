# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses historical stock market data to **predict future stock closing prices** using machine learning techniques. It combines data from multiple CSV files, processes it, trains a model, and visualizes the predictions to help identify trends and patterns in stock behavior.

## 🚀 Overview

- 📅 **Data**: Daily stock data from multiple CSV files  
- 🧠 **Model**: Machine Learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM)  
- 🧹 **Preprocessing**: Combines files, handles missing values, and creates features  
- 📊 **Prediction Goal**: Predict the **next day's closing price**  
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Uses metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² Score  
- 📉 **Visualization**: Line plots comparing predicted vs. actual prices  

## 🧠 Objective

To forecast stock prices based on historical patterns and market indicators, enabling better data-driven decisions in trading and investment.




The Stock csv file is too big to upload
