# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses historical stock market data to **predict future stock closing prices** using machine learning techniques. It combines data from multiple CSV files, processes it, trains a model, and visualizes the predictions to help identify trends and patterns in stock behavior.

## ðŸš€ Overvie

- ðŸ“… **Data**: Daily stock data from multiple CSV files  
- ðŸ§  **Model**: Machine Learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM)  
- ðŸ§¹ **Preprocessing**: Combines files, handles missing values, and creates features  
- ðŸ“Š **Prediction Goal**: Predict the **next day's closing price**  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Evaluation**: Uses metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score  
- ðŸ“‰ **Visualization**: Line plots comparing predicted vs. actual prices  

## ðŸ§  Objective

To forecast stock prices based on historical patterns and market indicators, enabling better data-driven decisions in trading and investment.
